Linked Visions
===================

The source for
[linkedvisions.artic.edu](http://linkedvisions.artic.edu), an application that
allows the user to visually explore the social and personal
connections between individuals in Whistler and Rousselâ€™s networks.

[Whistler and Roussel: Linked Visions](http://www.artic.edu/exhibition/whistler-and-roussel-linked-visions), an exhibition on view at the
Art Institute of Chicago in Fall 2015, featured prints and drawings by James
McNeill Whistler and Theodore Roussel. The exhibition showed that the
work Whistler and Roussel produced during the late 19th century was
not created in isolation, but was only possible in the context of
their dynamic, thriving community. This community of artists,
technicians, writers, publishers and models as well as their family
and friends encouraged experimentation and created space for insiders
and outsiders to explore a new world of artistic expression. In order
to bring this idea to life, a team at the Art Institute
created the Linked Visions interactive.

This is a d3.js network visualization powered by linked data. The data directory contains the triple files that populate the graph via RDF plugin for jquery. No database is required.

Analytics
====

To set analytics, replace the analytics.php file in the root of the project. This file should contain your analytics embed (with default pageviews disabled) and a JavaScript block which listens for 'vpv' events and manually triggers pageviews for your analytics system.


```
<?php // analytics.php ?>

<script>
  $('body').on('vpv', function() {
    // manually fire a pageview
  });
</script>
```
