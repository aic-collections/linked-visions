<p class="about">
This digital interactive allows users to explore the nature of Whistler and Roussel’s shared relationships and the correlated impact on artistic production in the literary and visual arts. This project was defined by the works included in <i>Whistler and Roussel: Linked Visions</i>, on view in the Jean and Stephen Goldman Prints and Drawings Galleries at the Art Institute of Chicago, June 20–September 27, 2015.

<p class="about">
We thank all the Art Institute staff who contributed to the conception, design, and execution of this project. Carissa Kowalski Dougherty and William James Robertson were instrumental in conceiving this innovative use of digital technology. Erin Hogan, Head of Interpretation and Communication, has shaped this initiative and helped give it visibility. Michael Neault, Director of Digital Experience and Access, has orchestrated the planning and production of the interactive. The interface design has been carried out by Michael Yap; the programming and development have been realized by Stefano Cossu, Tina Shah, and Nikhil Trivedi. Kelly McHugh, Production Coordinator, has managed every step of the process with efficiency and aplomb. Within the Department of Prints and Drawings, intern Nicky Yi Ni, has contributed research and has assisted with the rather complex collation and delivery of data and images. Meg Hausberg and Victoria Sancho Lobis served as co-curators for the exhibition.
